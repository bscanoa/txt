"Los colores son hermosos, tienen buena pigmentación y son fácil para difuminar",I dont even know were to begin with this eyeshadow palette thats how IMPRESSED I am!!! First off lets start by saying i dont write reviews unless i feel like something is worth reviewing I am going to give you a completely HONEST REVIEW!!! Lets start off with the look of the palette in my opnion the art on it is VERY eye catching AND super cute . So not only do you get a eyeshadow palette that has AMAZING BRITE COLORS but you also a palette thats worth displaying because I know some people display there eyeshadow palettes. Im going to give my most HONEST opnion and review this eyeshadow palette by answering questions that I look for  when reading a review that helps me make a descion on buying something or not so  here you go There are of course lots of other eyeshadow palettes that also have brite colors so why choose this one? Well there are lots of eyeshadow palettes that have very similar if not almost identical  colors in them but in this one there not only colors that LOOK BRITE BUT THEY ACTUALLY  APPLY TO YOUR EYE AS BRITE AS THEY LOOK!! So that means NO MORE APPLYING THEN REAPPLYING OVER AND OVER AGAIN to get to the color that you are aiming for so that means that the eyeshadows will LAST you longer !! Also when you apply  the eyeshadows they dont get all patchy looking. Another question i always have when purchasing eyeshadows is if they blend well These eyeshadows are very blendable. Another thing I ask is are these eyeshadows worth the price that there asking for them well my personal opnion is this is a good price for the quality of the eyeshadows that are in the palette. Also The fallout of the eyeshadows is very little! So theres my review if your asking my opnion well I think you should defiently get it!
Todo bien,I really  love  this palette!  The pigments  work so well  and also have a nice  tones for matching between them. The application  is easy. The unique  thing  that  I don't  love it is that some tones keep in my eyelid after removed my makeup.  But I think  that is super smart  buying  for the relation between quality  and price.
La super recomiendo los colores quedan muy lindos. Me encanta,Absolutely love this brand and this pallette! Colors are bright and beautiful and last all day
"Colores hermosos y llenos de vida, llegó en buenas condiciones y nada roto. Me encantó",Amazing color. High pigment. I love this. I was nervous bc I like to try before I buy. But I just went for it and I couldn't be happier!!! Washes off with a towel and water.
Colores vivos pigmentados puedo hacer bonitas recreaciones estan hermosa.,"Seriously disappointed, idk if its a knock off I'm not sure but I've hear great things from beauty  creations so I bought this palette here. And honestly its so weird how the pigment is. Its definitely pigmented but once I put it on my eyelid and begin to blend it the powder like brushes off instead of actually blending. I'm not sure if I'm explaining it right but save your money with this one"
